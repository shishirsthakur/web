What could it be, Paul?
"There's something In the way she moves"
I start think of what attracted me that's all
Just say whatever comes into your head each time
"Attracts me like a cauliflower", until you get the word
Yeah, but I've been through this one like for about six months
You haven't had 15 people joining in, though, no
I mean, just that line, I couldn't think anything like a
"Attracts me like a pomegranate"
(Something in the way) we could have that, attracts me like a pomegranate
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like a pomegranate
I think it's not good (cauliflower!)
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You know it's that one mic
'Cause if you try and make sense of it, every time
And every line, then you've got to stop every time
We'd just go on and go on, and then go back over it, yeah
You're done, even the line here
